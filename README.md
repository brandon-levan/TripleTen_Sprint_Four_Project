# TripleTen Sprint Four Project

## Project Description 

Using a car advertisement dataset (vehicles_us.csv), this TripleTen project aims to provide additional practice on common software engineering tasks to develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service.

For this project, I've created a Streamlit application hosted on Render that allows users in interact with the car advertisement dataset to uncover insights about what car attributes can increase its value on the secondary market. For additional context, the car advertisement dataset contains information on used car sales such as price, model year, model, car condition, number of cylinders, fuel type, miles on the odometer, transmission type, car type, paint color, four wheel drive, date posted, and days listed. Using data visualization, this project aims to uncover insights about which attributes have a directional impact on price and allows for users to interact with the plots to uncover their own findings. 

## How Was This Web Application Developed

To get the web application deployed on a cloud service that is accessible locally, there are a few steps that had to be completed - 

### Develop and Test Locally


It should contain a basic description of the project, explaining that this is a tool to simulate random events, and the methods and libraries used to implement it. It should also contain instructions on how other people could launch your project on their local machine if they wanted to.

## Conclusion 
Thank you for taking the time to view my repositi
provide you with additional practice on common software engineering tasks. These tasks will augment and complement your data skills, and make you a more attractive job candidate to potential employers. 
You will be asked to develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service so that it is accessible to the public.
In this project, we will provide you with the dataset on car sales advertisements, which you’ve already worked with in the past.
The project is split into several steps that replicate the process described in our blog post here, but we will be using the Render platform instead of Heroku.
